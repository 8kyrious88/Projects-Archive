                Welcome to Neven, your dedicated online destination for high-performance gaming computer components and accessories, including graphic cards, mechanical keyboards, gaming mice, and more. By accessing, browsing, or making a purchase through our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. These terms govern your use of our website and services and form a binding legal agreement between you and Neven.
                <br><br>
                All products listed on our website are subject to availability, and while we strive to keep our inventory updated, we reserve the right to modify or discontinue any item at any time without prior notice. All prices are stated in Singapore Dollars (SGD) and may be revised periodically. Price changes will not affect orders already confirmed. We currently accept payments via PayNow and bank transfer, and all payments must be made in full before orders are processed and shipped. Once payment is verified, we aim to dispatch your order within 2 to 5 business days, excluding weekends and public holidays. Shipping timelines may vary depending on your location, courier availability, and other external factors. Neven shall not be held responsible for delays caused by third-party logistics providers or customs processing.

                We are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction. If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may return the product within 90 days of the delivery date, provided that the item is unused, unopened, and in its original packaging. To initiate a return, you must first contact our customer service team at neven@gmail.com for return instructions. Items returned without prior authorization may not be accepted. Once we receive the returned item and verify its condition, we will process your refund within 90 days using your original payment method. Please note that original shipping costs are non-refundable, and customers are responsible for return shipping unless the item is faulty or incorrect.
